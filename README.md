# README - Business Optimization Using Linear Programming

## Objective
This project aims to solve a business problem using Linear Programming (LP) to optimize production decisions for maximizing profit. The optimization considers constraints like labor hours and material availability to determine the ideal number of products to manufacture.

## Key Activities
1. **Problem Formulation:**
   - Define decision variables representing the number of products to be produced.
   - Establish an objective function to maximize profit.

2. **Constraint Definition:**
   - Incorporate labor hour constraints.
   - Define material availability constraints.

3. **Solving the Optimization Problem:**
   - Use the `PuLP` library to define and solve the LP problem.
   - Implement a structured approach for constraint handling.

4. **Result Interpretation & Insights:**
   - Extract and present the optimal production quantities.
   - Evaluate total profit.
   - Provide insights on how constraints impact the solution.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
- **PuLP**: Linear programming optimization library.
- **Pandas**: For structured output representation and data analysis.

## Key Insights
- Linear programming effectively maximizes profit while adhering to real-world constraints.
- Constraints like labor and material availability significantly impact production levels.
- Optimization provides actionable insights for decision-making in business operations.

## Running the Optimization Script
### Prerequisites:
```bash
pip install pulp pandas
```
### Running the Script:
```bash
python business_optimization.py
```
### Expected Output:
- Optimal production quantities for each product.
- Maximum possible profit given constraints.
